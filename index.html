                                    was established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards and witches as well as to keep students safe from muggle (non-magic humans) prosecution. Students enter the school as 11-year-olds and are divided
                                    into one of four houses by a magical hat. It takes seven years to complete their education.

                                <h4>The Quokka, the happiest animal on earth</h4>

                                <p>The island of Rottnest near Perth, Australia is the primary home of the quokka, a type of marsupial. Quokkas have round, compact bodies that are 40-54 cm (16-21 in.) in length. They are covered with short, coarse brown-grey
                                    fur and have small rounded ears and a black nose.</p>

                                <p>An early Dutch visitor to the island, Willem de Vlamingh, mistook the marsupials for large rats when he arrived in <time datetime="1696">1696.</time>He named the island “Rattennest” (Dutch for “Rat’s Nest”), which was later
                                    adapted to Rottnest.</p>

                                <p>Aside from Rottnest Island, small groups of quokkas also inhabit the mainland in Western Australia, as well as Bald Island, a small island to the southwest. Groups of quokkas live in territories, which are defended by dominant
                                    males. They often live in tall grass near water sources. Quokkas can also climb trees!</p>

                                <p>Quokkas are herbivores who primarily feed at night, meaning they are mainly nocturnal. They eat the leaves, stems, and bark of many plants in addition to grass. If necessary, they can survive for long periods of time without
                                    food or water by living off the fat stored in their tails.</p>

                            <h4>Quokka selfies</h4>

                            <p>In the mid-2010s, quokkas earned a reputation on the internet as <em>"the world's happiest animals" and symbols of positivity</em> due to their beaming smiles. Many photos of smiling quokkas have since gone viral, and the <strong>"quokka selfie"</strong>                                has become a popular social media trend, with celebrities such as Chris Hemsworth, Shawn Mendes, Margot Robbie and Roger Federer participating. Tourist numbers to Rottnest Island have subsequently increased.</p>

                            <p>Noting the popularity of smiling quokkas, the fact-checking website Snopes confirmed in <time datetime="2020">2020</time> that the animal exists, saying it had received questions from readers who thought it "was simply too
                                cute to be real".</p>
