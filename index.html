                        in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards and witches as well as to keep students safe from muggle (non-magic humans) prosecution. Students enter the school as 11-year-olds and are divided into one of four houses by
                        a magical hat. It takes seven years to complete their education.

              </dfn> examinations. The OWLs are standardized tests that determine if a student can go on taking specific courses their few next years. <br/>

                    JK Rowling. The book series was made into a series of films, a sequel two-performance play, and now a series of prequels, the Fantastic Beasts films. JK Rowling has come under scrutiny in recent years for her comments about transgender
                    individuals.
